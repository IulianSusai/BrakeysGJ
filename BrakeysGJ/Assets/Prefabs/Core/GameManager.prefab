  startDialog:
  - Hello there! Are you up for another game jam?
  - Let me tell you how to play. Use the arrow keys to move and Space to jump.
  - You would want to use me to light up your way! Move me from torch to torch
  - Use RIGHT CONTROL key to change between me and you. And move me with the Arrow
    Keys.
  - Ohh... I almost forgot, I have to recharge from time to time so is best to keep
    me near a torch!
  - 'I know it''s dark, but it''s ok you know this place! '
  - Let's get going!
  endDialog:
  - Yeeey!!! You've reached the final... You did it!
  - That was really fun. I hope you liked it too!
  - That is the exit from here... I know you are confused with what is this place.
  - You will come here, many more times from now on... This place... This is where
    your thoughts are!
  - But I will be here and help you light up the darkest corners of your thoughts,
    I am after all....
  - Motivation, a dim light that keeps you going!
  - Thanks for hanging with my thoughts for a while.
  - 'See you again, keep your head up! Bye!! '
